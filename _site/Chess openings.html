<p><a href="Adelaide Counter Gambit"><strong>Adelaide Counter Gambit</strong></a></p>

<p>The Adelaide Counter Gambit is a solid attack against the King’s Gambit for black and begins with the moves:</p>

<p><a href="Albin Counter-Gambit"><strong>Albin Counter-Gambit</strong></a></p>

<p>The Albin Counter-Gambit is a hyper aggressive defense for black against the ever so popular queens gambit from white.</p>

<p><a href="Benoni Defense"><strong>Benoni Defense</strong></a></p>

<p>The Benoni Defense is a very aggressive line that black can play to counter the very common open by white d4. While many defenses against the queen pawn opening are closed and drawish, the Benoni Defense gives black many opportunities to not only equalize the position, but also to gain an advantage and play for the win.</p>

<p><a href="Bird’s Opening"><strong>Bird’s Opening</strong></a></p>

<p>The Bird’s Opening is the 6th most popular opening and is a very aggressive opening. White starts out weakening his king side and starts a flank attack on the center with his f pawn. This opening is not used in lots of top level play but some of the most beautiful games in chess history have been played using the Bird’s Opening.</p>

<p>The Blackmar-Diemer Gambit is one of the most ambitious attempts for white to gain a developmental advantage.</p>

<p><a href="Bogo Indian Defense"><strong>Bogo Indian Defense</strong></a></p>

<p>The Bogo Indian Defense is a chess opening that arrives after the starting moves:</p>

<p><a href="Calabrese Countergambit"><strong>Calabrese Countergambit</strong></a></p>

<p>The Italian Game is white’s effort to quickly develop his light square bishop and dominate the center of the board. The Calabrese Countergambit is black’s way of giving up his f-pawn to completely thwart all of white’s game plan. The more aggressive white tries to be in the opening the more potential traps he can fall into.</p>

<p><a href="Caro-Kann"><strong>Caro-Kann</strong></a></p>

<p>The Caro-Kann Defense is one of the most popular openings in response to the King’s Pawn Opening.</p>

<p>The Colorado Gambit is an aggressive line in the Nimzowitsch Defence. Black looks to weaken his king side pawn structure in exchange for some deadly attacks against white. This is a solid opening for black but usually works best as a surprise opening against a player that hasn’t studied all of the lines.</p>

<p>The Elephant Gambit is an uncommon gambit that arrives after the starting moves:</p>

<p><a href="English Opening"><strong>English Opening</strong></a></p>

<p>The English opening is the 4th most common opening for white. Although the English has its own style, the opening is very flexible and many times transposes into other opening lines. The objective of the opening is to apply pressure on the center d5 square without committing the queen pawn or the king pawn. Since the move is a flank move many players like the English because of its hypermodern style of play (using pieces from the sides along with minor pieces to apply pressure and control the center).</p>

<p>The Fried Liver Attack is one of the most aggressive openings from white as you will be sacrificing one of your minor pieces very early in the game.</p>

<p><a href="Giuoco Piano"><strong>Giuoco Piano</strong></a></p>

<p>The Giuoco Piano is said to be the oldest opening recorded in chess. Instead of developing the bishop to b5, white instead attacks the center and aims at the weak f7 square. After black responds bishop to c5 you see the tension building up in the center of the board.</p>

<p><a href="Grob Attack"><strong>Grob Attack</strong></a></p>

<p>The Grob Attack is not a common opening and many people think of it as one of white’s weakest opening choices because it doesn’t attack the center of the board and it weakens the king’s safety. It begins with the move:</p>

<p><a href="Grunfeld Defense"><strong>Grunfeld Defense</strong></a></p>

<p>The Grunfeld Defense is a hypermodern defense, meaning that it doesn’t try to control the center early on with his pawns. Instead black tries to attack the center with this minor pieces from the sides and then once the foundation is in place, then looks to undermine the center control that white usually has.</p>

<p><a href="Jerome Gambit"><strong>Jerome Gambit</strong></a></p>

<p>The Jerome Gambit is an extremely aggressive opening that usually derives from the Giuoco Piano. White sacrifices both his king side bishop and knight in exchange for an exposed king and the possibility of an aggressive attack. Moves usually start with:</p>

<p><a href="King’s Gambit"><strong>King’s Gambit</strong></a></p>

<p>The King’s Gambit is one of the oldest openings in chess and for good reason. The possibilities the opening presents have intrigued the greatest chess minds for years including greats such as Spassky, Tal, and Fischer. White, on the second move challenges black’s center and begins an attack at the black kingside.</p>

<p><a href="Latvian Gambit"><strong>Latvian Gambit</strong></a></p>

<p>The Latvian Gambit is a very aggressive opening defense for black against one of the more common openings for white. This opening is not seen much at master level chess as most masters refuse to give up material early on in a game. Below master level play there are strong advocates of the Latvian Gambit and I personally enjoy the possibilities that arise from this opening.</p>

<p><a href="Locock Gambit"><strong>Locock Gambit</strong></a></p>

<p>The Locock Gambit is a very aggressive line in the Philidor Defense and starts with the moves:</p>

<p><a href="Petrov Defense"><strong>Petrov Defense</strong></a></p>

<p>The Petrov Defense, sometimes referred to as the Russian game is one of the more popular games with GMs because of its generally drawish tendencies. Many other players prefer to play the Petrov Defense so that they can avoid the lines of the Ruy Lopez, the Italian Game and the Scotch Game. For those players that like to play e5 but don’t like the normal defenses, then this might be a good alternative.</p>

<p><a href="Philidor Defense"><strong>Philidor Defense</strong></a></p>

<p>The Philidor Defense is an alternative move to the more common 2…Nc6 move from black. While very solid, it is extremely passive and thought to be a weaker option to Nc6. Because of this, it is rare to see at high level play.</p>

<p><a href="Pirc Defense"><strong>Pirc Defense</strong></a></p>

<p>The Pirc Defense is a hypermodern defense, meaning that it doesn’t try to control the center early on with his pawns. Instead black tries to attack the center with this minor pieces from the sides and then once the foundation is in place, then looks to undermine the center control that white usually has.</p>

<p><a href="Reti Opening"><strong>Reti Opening</strong></a></p>

<p>The Reti Opening has at times been referred to as the Opening of the Future. It is called this because of how easy it is to transpose into a variety of different opening lines. Many players have a very defined defense as black but against the Reti, black is forced to almost wait and see which opening line white will take. Some of the main opening lines that the Reti will transpose into are the Queen’s Gambit, the English, the Ruy Lopez, or the King’s Indian Attack. As you can tell, white has many different options to choose from, even after he has already moved.</p>

<p>The Ruy Lopez is the cornerstone of classical play in chess. There are probably more variations for the Ruy Lopez than any other opening. With the common use of the double king’s pawn opening (1.e4 e5), the Ruy Lopez is one of the most played openings that any chess player will come across. It’s almost imperative that any chess player study some of the more popular defenses against the Ruy Lopez and understand some of the key concepts of the opening.</p>

<p>The Scotch Game has recently regained popularity as many top level players have used it as a surprise against players who are well equipped to face the Ruy Lopez. The Scotch is very similar to the Center Game where d4 opens up lines for development and also gives white early center control. In the Scotch Game, black will be able to develop easy and white should look to take advantage of its special and center control.</p>

<p>The Sicilian Defense is the most popular defense against white’s opening 1.e4 and is used extensively at top level play. It is a very aggressive defense and immediately stakes claim at the center, denying white the double pawns on e4 and d4. Many chess champions actually prefer to start with 1.d4 because of how well the Sicilian Defense plays against 1.e4.</p>
